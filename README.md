# Rock, Paper, Scissors

This is a simple JavaScript implementation of a basic rock, paper, scissors game. It currently will have no GUI, however that will be added later. For now it's all very basic.

It uses alert() and prompt() to communicate with the user. The game is a best of 5 and to the victor go the spoils.
